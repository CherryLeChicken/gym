# Chin Up - Voice-Guided Fitness Companion

A real-time, voice-first fitness companion that analyzes exercise form through the camera, provides corrective feedback, and encourages users using AI-generated voice.

## Features

- **Real-time Pose Detection**: Uses TensorFlow.js MoveNet for accurate body keypoint detection
- **Form Analysis**: Analyzes exercise form and provides real-time feedback
- **Voice Feedback**: AI-powered voice guidance using ElevenLabs TTS API
- **Accessibility-First**: Voice-first interface designed for beginners and neurodivergent users

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Modern browser with camera access (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- ElevenLabs API key (optional - falls back to Web Speech API if not provided)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gym
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your ElevenLabs API key:

```
VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> **Note**: If you don't have an ElevenLabs API key, the app will fall back to the browser's Web Speech API.

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. **Grant Camera Access**: When prompted, allow the browser to access your camera
2. **Select Exercise**: Choose an exercise from the list (currently supports Squat)
3. **Start Workout**: Click the "Start" button to begin pose detection
4. **Receive Feedback**: The app will provide real-time voice and visual feedback on your form
